# Workspace Setup

Run this file with each agent you plan to use in this workspace:

```
claude "Read SETUP.md and follow the setup instructions"
codex  "Read SETUP.md and follow the setup instructions"
```

The shared sections only need to be completed once — whichever agent runs first
handles them. Each agent then completes its own section. Check the Status block
to see what still needs to be done before starting.

---

## Status

shared: pending
claude: pending
codex:  pending

<!-- orc doctor checks these lines — do not remove them. -->
<!-- Change each to "complete" when that section is finished. -->

---

## Instructions for the Agent

1. Read the Status block above.
2. Skim `orc.yaml`, `ROUTER.md`, and `TOOLS.md` so you know what you are filling in.
3. If `shared: pending` — complete the Shared sections first, then mark `shared: complete`.
4. If `shared: complete` — skip to your own agent section (Claude or Codex).
5. Complete your agent section and mark it `complete` in the Status block.
6. Print a summary of every file you created or updated.

Do not re-run sections already marked complete.

## Shared Section 1: Ticket System

The ticket system is described in two files, each owning a different concern.
Fill each field in its designated file and do not duplicate values between them —
`ROUTER.md` is the source of truth for *how to retrieve* a ticket.

**Ask the user:**
> What system do you use for tickets or stories?
> (1) Jira  (2) GitHub Issues  (3) Linear  (4) Local markdown files  (5) None / manual

**Update `ROUTER.md` (retrieval — the source of truth):**
- The exact command to retrieve a ticket by ID. **Do not guess this.** If you
  don't already know the user's exact command, propose one and ask them to
  confirm or correct it before writing it (e.g. for GitHub Issues you can
  propose `gh issue view <id>`; for Jira/Linear/custom setups, ask).
- Any authentication requirements (env var, API key location) — ask the user

**Update `TOOLS.md` (identity and access):**
- System name
- Project / team keys
- Ticket URL format
- The MCP server name the user gave this system, if any (MCP config itself lives
  at the user level — `~/.claude/mcp.json` or the Codex equivalent — record only
  the name here). Ask the user for it.

---

## Shared Section 2: Source Control

**Ask the user:**
> What source control system do you use?
> (1) GitHub  (2) GitLab  (3) Bitbucket  (4) Other / none

**Then ask, and record each in the Source Control section of `TOOLS.md`:**
> 1. Org / repo (e.g. myorg/myrepo)
> 2. Default branch (e.g. main)
> 3. PR target branch (e.g. main, or a release branch)
> 4. The MCP server name you gave source control, if any

**Update `TOOLS.md`:**
- Fill in the platform name and the four fields above
- Note: MCP servers are configured at the user level, not per-workspace —
  record only the name

---

## Shared Section 3: Repos and Routes

Repos live wherever they are on the filesystem. Worktrees for ticket work are
always created inside this workspace under `worktrees/`.

**Ask the user:**
> How many code repositories does this workspace orchestrate?

**For each repo ask:**
> 1. Short name (e.g. "my-app", "qa-suite")
> 2. Full path on the filesystem (e.g. /Users/me/projects/my-app)
> 3. Purpose (one line)

**Then update `orc.yaml`:**
- Replace the example entry under `repos:` with the real repos (name, path, purpose)

**And update `ROUTER.md`:**
- Fill in the `git worktree add` example command with the actual workspace path

---

## Shared Section 4: Workflow and Workers

This section makes the workflow match the user's process and ensures every
`worker:` id referenced in `orc.yaml` resolves to a real worker file.

**Review the workflow with the user:**
- Show them the `workflows:` block in `orc.yaml` (the default flow is
  `intake → develop → pr-open → qa-automation`).
- Ask whether these stages and their order match how they work. Add, remove, or
  reorder stages as needed. Each stage references a worker by `id`.

**Find the required worker ids:**
- Run `orc doctor`. It reports any stage whose `worker:` id has no matching file —
  that is your checklist of workers that must exist.

**Make every worker id resolve** (engine and model are assigned later, in the
Claude / Codex sections):
- If you ran `orc init --with-sample-workers`, `workers/` already contains
  `fred-documentor`, `bob-developer`, `zach-reviewer`, `brian-qa`, and others —
  edit those rather than creating new ones.
- If `workers/` only has `_template.md`, copy it once per `worker:` id in `orc.yaml`.

---

## Shared Section 5: Team Conventions and Approval Policy

**Ask the user:**
> Any team conventions agents should follow? (PR size, commit message style,
> review norms, branch naming, anything else)

**Update `AGENTS.md`:**
- Record the answers under the `## Team Conventions` heading at the bottom

**Review `RULES.md` with the user:**
- `RULES.md` defines what requires human approval (opening PRs, triggering CI,
  writing to the ticket system, posting external comments).
- Confirm the defaults match the team's policy and adjust if needed.

---

## Claude Section

**Ask the user:**
> Do you want to use Claude in this workspace? (yes / no / already configured)

- If **no** — mark `claude: complete` and skip this section.
- If **already configured** — verify each Claude worker has `engine: claude` and a
  valid `model:`, confirm the `TOOLS.md` Claude MCP line is filled in, then mark
  `claude: complete`.

**Ask:**
> Which Claude model should Claude-run workers use?
> (1) claude-opus-4-8  (2) claude-sonnet-4-6  (3) claude-haiku-4-5-20251001

**Ask:**
> Do you have MCP servers configured in ~/.claude/mcp.json?
> List the names of any you want agents in this workspace to use.
> (These are already installed at the user level — we just need the names.)

**Then:**
- For each worker you want Claude to run, set `engine: claude` and
  `model: <chosen model>` in its frontmatter. A worker runs on exactly one
  engine — assign each role to Claude or Codex, not both.
- Update `TOOLS.md` — in the **MCP Servers** section, fill in the **Claude** line
  with the server names the user provided.
- Run `orc doctor` and confirm no `orc.yaml` stage reports a missing worker.

---

## Codex Section

**Ask the user:**
> Do you want to use Codex in this workspace? (yes / no / already configured)

- If **no** — mark `codex: complete` and skip this section.
- If **already configured** — verify each Codex worker has `engine: codex` and a
  valid `model:` (or a deliberate default), confirm the `TOOLS.md` Codex MCP line
  is filled in, then mark `codex: complete`.

**Ask:**
> Which Codex model should Codex-run workers use? (press enter for default)

**Ask:**
> Do you have MCP servers or tools configured for Codex?
> List the names of any you want agents in this workspace to use.

**Then:**
- For each worker you want Codex to run, set `engine: codex` and
  `model: <chosen model or omit for default>` in its frontmatter. A worker runs
  on exactly one engine — assign each role to Claude or Codex, not both.
- Update `TOOLS.md` — in the **MCP Servers** section, fill in the **Codex** line
  with any tools or server names the user provided.
- Run `orc doctor` and confirm no `orc.yaml` stage reports a missing worker.

---

## Final Step

When your section is complete:
1. Update the Status block at the top — mark `shared: complete` if you completed it,
   and mark `claude: complete` or `codex: complete` for your agent section
2. Run `orc doctor` yourself and read the output. If it reports any problems
   (missing workers, unresolved files, an incomplete SETUP), fix them and run it
   again. Do not declare setup done until `orc doctor` is clean — then show the
   user the result.
3. If both agents are configured, tell the user they can now run `orc work <ticket>`
