# features/

Each subfolder is a durable context pack for one ticket. State survives session
changes, agent switches, and restarts — everything needed to pick up where work
left off is in these files.

Start a new ticket with:

```
orc work TICKET-0000
```

## Structure

```
features/
  _template/            copied for each new ticket by orc work
  _archive/             completed features moved here by orc archive
  TICKET-0000-slug/
    STATE.yaml          current stage, owner, status, next action
    TICKET.md           ticket description and acceptance criteria
    SPEC.md             context, scope, and open questions
    PLAN.md             implementation approach and steps
    DECISIONS.md        significant decisions and rationale
    develop/            outputs written by the develop stage
      HANDOFF.md        implementation summary and known risks
    code-review/        outputs written by the code-review stage
      REVIEW.md         findings and verdict
    pr-open/            outputs written by the pr-open stage
      PR.md             PR URL and status
    qa-automation/      outputs written by the qa-automation stage
      SOURCE_CONTEXT.md repo context for the QA agent
      PLAN.md           test cases and coverage plan
      RUNS.md           test run history
      RESULT.md         final result and evidence
```

Each stage writes its outputs to a subfolder matching its name. Stages create their
own subfolder — nothing is pre-created in the template.
