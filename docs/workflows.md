# Workflow Configuration

`orc.yaml` is the workspace configuration file. It defines the repos a workspace
can use, the named workflows tickets can follow, and the default safety settings
for launching and archiving work.

Workflow policy belongs in `orc.yaml` and worker markdown files. `orc` enforces
generic state transitions and safety rules around that policy.

## File Shape

```yaml
settings:
  default_workflow: default
  auto_archive: false
  auto_tmux: false
  auto_next: false
  tui_refresh: 60
  theme: catppuccin-mocha

repos:
  - name: my-app
    path: ../my-app
    purpose: Application code, APIs, tests

workflows:
  default:
    stages:
      - name: intake
        worker: fred-documentor
        advance: auto
      - name: develop
        worker: bob-developer
        advance: manual
        loop:
          via: code-review
          worker: zach-reviewer
          max: 3
          on_max: pause
      - name: pr-open
        worker: bob-developer
        advance: manual
      - name: qa-automation
        worker: brian-qa
        advance: auto
```

## Settings

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `default_workflow` | Yes, when workflows exist | Workflow used by `orc work <ticket>` when `--workflow` is omitted. |
| `auto_archive` | No | Archives tickets automatically after the last stage completes. |
| `auto_tmux` | No | Uses tmux for new ticket launches by default. Same intent as `orc work --tmux`. |
| `auto_next` | No | Launches the first stage immediately after `orc work`. Same intent as `orc work --next`. |
| `tui_refresh` | No | TUI refresh interval in seconds. Defaults to 60 when unset or zero. |
| `theme` | No | TUI color theme. Defaults to `catppuccin-mocha`. |
| `quotes` | No | Optional TUI status quotes. |

## Repos

`repos` describes source repositories available to the workspace.

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `name` | Yes | Stable repo identifier used in state and displays. |
| `path` | Yes | Path to the repo, usually relative to the workspace root. |
| `purpose` | No | Human-readable description of what belongs in the repo. |

## Workflows

`workflows` is a map of workflow names to ordered stage lists. A ticket stores
its selected workflow in `STATE.yaml`. If the ticket omits `workflow`, `orc`
uses `settings.default_workflow`.

Each workflow stage supports:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `name` | Yes | Stage identifier. Also names the stage instruction file in `stages/<name>.md`. |
| `worker` | Yes | Worker ID from `workers/*.md` that owns the stage by default. |
| `advance` | Yes | Completion mode. Valid values are `auto` and `manual`. |
| `loop` | No | Optional repair/review loop attached to this stage. |

## Advance Modes

`advance: auto` means the agent should run `orc mark <ticket> next --result
"<summary>"` when the stage is complete.

`advance: manual` means the agent should run `orc mark <ticket> pause
"<summary>"` so a human can review before advancing.

## Loops

A `loop` attaches a non-linear repair or review stage to a main workflow stage.
The loop stage is not part of the normal stage order. It is entered only when the
owning stage sends the ticket there.

```yaml
- name: develop
  worker: bob-developer
  advance: manual
  loop:
    via: code-review
    worker: zach-reviewer
    max: 3
    on_max: pause
```

Loop fields:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `via` | Yes | Loop stage name. |
| `worker` | Yes | Worker ID assigned to the loop stage. |
| `max` | No | Maximum loop count before `on_max` behavior applies. |
| `on_max` | No | Behavior when the loop count reaches `max`. `pause` (default) pauses for human review. `fail` marks the ticket done immediately. |

## Validation Expectations

Workspace configuration should satisfy these rules:

- `settings.default_workflow` names an existing workflow when workflows are configured.
- Every stage has a non-empty `name`.
- Stage names are unique within a workflow, including loop stage names.
- Every stage `worker` and loop `worker` names an existing file in `workers/`.
- `advance` is either `auto` or `manual`.
- `loop.via` names a loop stage owned by exactly one workflow stage.
- `loop.on_max`, when set, is `pause` or `fail`.

`orc` validates this configuration in the paths that would otherwise route work:

- `orc doctor` reports invalid config under the `config` check.
- `orc doctor <ticket>` validates workspace config along with that ticket's `STATE.yaml`.
- `orc next <ticket>` refuses to launch when the workspace config is invalid.
- `orc mark <ticket> next` refuses to advance when the workspace config is invalid.

## State Transitions

Agents should use `orc mark`; they should not hand-edit `STATE.yaml`.

| Command | Allowed From | Result |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| `orc mark <ticket> start` | `pending`, `ready` | Marks the ticket `active` and records the session start. |
| `orc mark <ticket> resume` | `paused` | Marks the ticket `active` and records the continuation. Clears the human-directed next action set by `pause`. |
| `orc mark <ticket> next --result "<summary>"` | `active`, `ready`, `paused` | Advances to the next workflow stage, returns from a loop stage, or marks the ticket `done` after the final stage. |
| `orc mark <ticket> next --stage <name> --worker <id>` | `active`, `ready`, `paused` | Moves to a configured workflow or loop stage and assigns the named worker. |
| `orc mark <ticket> pause "<reason>"` | Any non-final feature state | Marks the ticket `paused` and records why a human or external condition is needed. |
| `orc mark <ticket> done --result "<summary>"` | `active`, `ready`, `paused` | Explicitly closes active work. |

Transition validation rejects:

- `start` from `paused`; use `resume` to continue a paused ticket.
- `resume` from any status other than `paused`.
- `next` while a ticket is still `pending`; start the session first.
- `done` while a ticket is still `pending`.
- `next --stage` values that do not name a configured workflow or loop stage.
- `next --worker` values that do not name a worker file in `workers/`.

## Where to Put Policy

- Put stage order, default workers, and loop shape in `orc.yaml`.
- Put agent behavior, model choice, permissions, and launch defaults in `workers/*.md`.
- Put per-stage instructions in `stages/<stage>.md`.
- Put current ticket state in `features/<slug>/STATE.yaml`.
- Put code-level safety checks in `orc` internals only when they are generic across workflows.
